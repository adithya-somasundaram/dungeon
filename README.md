# Dungeon! Version 1.0
Welcome to Dungeon! In this game the user (you) has to navigate through a maze in order to reach the finishing point. The user automically starts with 3 lives, and if you run into 3 enemies, you lose! The game is played in the terminal, and the user's position, lives and available moves are displayed back to you after every move. To safely quit at any point, enter 'Q'.

## Running the application
After installation, to create the executable run:
```
g++ main.cpp game.cpp player.cpp
```
Then to run:
```
./a.out
```
To be worked on: Adding user items and inventory, customizing enemies, more maps
