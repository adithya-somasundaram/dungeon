# Dungeon! Version 1.0
Welcome to Dungeon! In this game the user (you) has to navigate through a maze in order to reach the finishing point. The user automically starts with 3 lives, and if you run into 3 enemies, you lose! The game is played in the terminal, and the user's position, lives and available moves are displayed back to you after every move. To safely quit at any point, enter 'Q'.
